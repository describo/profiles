# Describo Profiles

Describo is driven by profiles. A profile is a set of instructions to the UI to describe how it
should act. This repository is the documentation for writing a profile. It also contains a small
application you can use to validate your profile. And there are example profiles in the repository
as well.

Comprehensive documentation is available @
